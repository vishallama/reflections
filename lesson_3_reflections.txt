Q. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A. We would want to use a remote repository in the following scenarios:
   (1) If multiple people contribute to the same repository, then it is in fact 
even necessary to maintain a remote repository so that those people can push or 
pull from such a repository. This also enables each of those contributors to keep 
their work synced with those of others'.
   (2) In the case of a local machine failure, local data corruption, and other 
such scenarios, it doesn't make sense to keep all of one's work in a local machine. Such work could easily get lost when the aforesaid scenarios occur.

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A. In the scenario when there are multiple people contributing to a single remote 
repository, if Git is automatically allowed to sync the remote repository with 
my local one, then one could potentially lose all local changes when such a pull 
request is allowed. Manual pulling allows one to pull commits from a remote 
repository only when one is sure that doing so would not mess with any work done 
locally.
