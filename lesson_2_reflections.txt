Q. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A. Git creates a .git subdirectory, which it uses to keep track of all 
commits. We need it, for otherwise, Git won't be able to keep track of all 
the changes we make to files in the directory.

Q. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

A. The staging area keeps track of all the files that we have "added" to 
the git repository. From there, those files can be "committed". The staging 
area provides a finer level of control over what we wish to commit to our 
respository. We may not want to track all files in our directory after all. 
The staging area lets us do that.
